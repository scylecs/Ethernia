mechanics:
	for each advantage stack, roll an additional time and take the highest roll. for each disadvantage stack, roll an additional time and take the lowest roll. each advantage and disadvantage cancels out
	focus abilities have a concentration upkeep that decrements concentration cap
	at turn start, set concentration and action points to cap, then apply status effects
	at turn end, lose all remaining bonus action points
	when an attacker attacks a defender, if attacker's attack value > defender's defense value and the defense is not a success, the attack counts as a success. the attacker then deals (attacker's damage roll - defender's damage reduction roll) (min 1 damage) damage to the defender's sp. if defender's sp is reduced to 0, any overflowing damage is dealt to the defender's hp.
	if attacker's attack value > (defender's defense value + 100), attacker's attack is a critical attack
	for each 0.1*(hp cap) hp missing, unit gains an additional wounded status. at half hp or less, unit is incapacitated.
	can only dual wield light weapons. dual wielding the same type of weapon decrements weapon action use by 1 and applies a 0.6+0.003*(dual wield skill) multiplier to prof when calculating melee attack, melee damage, parry defense
	a ranged attack value < 61 always misses
	when wielding a shield, parrying attacks from where unit is facing does not cost parry tokens
	unlocking a feat further multiplies the requirements for all feat requirements by 1.01 for each tier. cannot unlock feats if doing so would make the requirement of any existing feat higher than unit base attribute
	upon taking damage, decrement concentration by hp lost
	while focused, travel at half speed and cannot rest, recover wounds, use out-of-combat skills
	only creatures within vision can become targets
	if unit ever has insufficient concentration, deactivate the focus ability with the highest upkeep, and gain staggered (1). continue until unit has sufficient concentration. if there are no active focus abilities and unit still has insufficient concentration, gain stunned (1)
	lower feat id's on-condition effects are applied first
	muted statuses will still be gained and lost as usual, but otherwise do not apply their internal effects to the unit
	while prone: melee attacks and defense against melee attacks have disadvantage, ranged attacks againts this unit has disadvantage, cannot step or dash, can crawl
	light weapon weight <= t
	heavy weapon weight > 2*t
	max weapon weight <= 3*t
